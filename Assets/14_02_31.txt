Great job on completing your liquid mixtures lab! I see that you added 9 liquids to the beakers during the lab, and the expected number of liquids to be added was also 9. You followed the correct procedure in terms of the number of liquids added, which is excellent!

Now, let's dive into the science behind the lab you conducted. In this experiment, you were demonstrating subtractive color mixing. When we talk about colors, we are referring to how light interacts with objects. The colors we see are based on the wavelengths of light that are reflected or absorbed by an object. 

Subtractive color mixing occurs when we mix colored substances together. Each color absorbs certain wavelengths of light and reflects others. When mixed, the resulting color is the combination of the wavelengths that are not absorbed by the individual colors. This is a fundamental concept in understanding how various colors interact and blend to produce new colors.

Your performance in the lab was spot on in terms of following the required steps and understanding the concept of subtractive color mixing. By successfully combining the liquids and observing the resulting colors, you were able to visually demonstrate how colors interact and create new shades through subtraction of certain wavelengths.

Based on your performance and adherence to the lab requirements, I would give you an **A grade** for this lab. Keep up the excellent work, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions or need further clarification!
